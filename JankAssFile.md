[Verse 1]
Baby, do you understand me now?
Sometimes I feel a little mad
But don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel?
When things go wrong, I seem to be bad

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Bridge]
If I seem edgy, I want you to know
That I never meant to take it out on you
Life has its problems and I've got my share
That's one thing I never meant to do
'Cause I love you
[Verse 2]
Baby, don't you know I'm just human
And I've got thoughts like any other man?
And sometimes I feel myself alone, regretting
Some foolish thing, some foolish thing I've done

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Oh Lord, don't you let me be misunderstood
Don't let me be...
Don't let me be misunderstood
No, no, no, no, no, no

[Instrumental Break]

Oh, come to me, baby
Esmeralda
Come on, baby
You're so sweet
My sweet Esmeralda, babe
Help me, help me, I love you
Oh, don't play with me, baby
Come on, come to me
Esmeralda
Oh, baby, oh, please
Oh, I need you, baby

But don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel?
When things go wrong, I seem to be bad

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 3]
Baby, sometimes I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And sometimes it seems that all I have to do is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Bridge]
If I seem edgy, I want you to know
That I never meant to take it out on you
Life has its problems and I've got my share

Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
